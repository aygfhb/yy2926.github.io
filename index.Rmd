  Hello! Welcome to my website! Website is still under constructing, and lots of pages are unavailable, sorry! My name is Yuxin Yang. I recently graduated from Columbia University with a Master of Science degree, and I majored in statistics during my undergraduate school at the University of Florida. I am currently looking for a full-time position in Data analyst, Data scientist, or Biostatistician.

  I am the kind of person who is super passionate about math, number, and data. I'm interested in understanding the complex dataset, working on data, and presenting the result with visualized data. I am experienced with data processing, statistical modeling, and machine learning. I also have a fundamental understanding of deep learning and data mining. I am proficient with R (tidyverse, ggplot, lme4, randomForest, glmnet, R shiny...), Python (Numpy, Scipy, matplotlib, pandas, TensorFlow...), SQL, SAS. I listed several projects, most of them come with the R codes, and some of them done by Python.

    '<a href="./logistic-lasso-for-breast-cancer.html">Implementing Logistic-LASSO for Predicting Breast Cancer</a>'
  ),
  `Description` = c(
    "Using the Metropolis-Hasting Algorithm to predict the path of Atlantic hurricanes",
    "Examining the significant proteins to Down syndrome in mice",
    "Using coordinate-wise optimization to recreate the fused lasso"
  )
)
knitr::kable(tib)
```

I have a running list of my [other projects](./projects.html) here as well. If interested, you can also have a peek at my [resume](./resume.html).
